# Cannon Fodder Original Engine Bugs
  
Issues in the original engine which have been fixed  (unfortunately this list is not complete, as some bugs have been fixed and forgotten)
  
* The second and third squad grenade and rocket count did not refresh after using either weapon

* If the mouse was kept in the sidebar while changing squads, the camera would get stuck in a back and forth pattern

* Out of bounds memory accesses. Numerous code accessed past either the beginning or end of a few arrays. This was not really a noticable problem on the Amiga or in Dos but is on a modern OS with virtual memory (especially on dynamically allocated memory)

* Having a grenade explode at the bottom right corner of a map would cause memory corruption after the map array

* Some maps from the demos version may cause problems (AOS4)
